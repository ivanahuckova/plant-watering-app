# Planto - The Plant Watering App 🌵

Welcome! 👋 This repository contains the source code and content for a marketing webpage for fictional company Planto 🌿: the home page and blog page. This webpage was created as a part of the Lambda's Project Week: User Interface. Website was created from scratch and was inspired by a beautiful 💜 web page of Acts Of Random Kideness (https://ark.cregital.com/). The main goal was to demonstrate the ablility to combine HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Libraries, and Programming Paradigms into one project.

Website is live and running on https://planto-the-plant-watering-app.herokuapp.com/.
