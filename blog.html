				<h3>I Overwatered my Rubber Plant and this is what I learnt.</h3>
				<p class="date">February 3 2019</p>
				<p class="blog-text text-dixplay-none">
					If you hang out on Instagram these days, you will see plants in their prime, with extraordinarily fresh leaves, an elegant stand, incredible
					colors or rare features. It’s nice to photograph them straight out from the plant nursery, but it’s nicer to be able to maintain them in
					‘instagrammable’ condition. You know it by now, my focus is all about helping you care for your favorite plants on the long run. That’s why
					in this aricle I will give you a step-by-step explanation of how I over-watered my rubber plant and how I fortunately realized the issue
					before it was too late. I hope all the rubber plant parents out there will benefit from that! In a rush? Scroll straight down to see the
					care tips now.
                </br>
            </br>
					I was about to go on holidays and decided to water my rubber plant (Ficus Elastica) one last time. I'm always careful when I water my rubber
					plant because I know that it doesn't tolerate large amounts of water very well. At home, this plant is still potted in its original plastic
					pot. But it is placed inside a larger decorative ceramic pot (as you can see above) and overlaid with a thick layer of moss. So, the plastic
					pot is out of reach, and, because of that, I'm forced to water from above, which makes things even more difficult. My preferred watering
					technique is to water from below instead (soaking it in a tray) because it's more homogeneous and the plant can absorb just what it wants
					before I drain excess water away. Back to my story, I didn't have a choice and watered with the content of one large glass and left for
					vacation. I guess that it is the technique that's used by many of you, so I thought that it was worth writing about it. Guess what happened
					next? When I came back two of the bottom leaves were feeling unwell and turned yellow. One yellow leaf dropped this morning when I moved the
					plant and the other one will follow soon, sadly. Not sure if I'll be able to recover this leaf. Let's analyze what's happened and learn
					something.
